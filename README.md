# Knajp's Engine

I really couldn't think of a better name.

A non-voxel (though possible voxel implementation in the future) game engine, mostly for personal use. Started to expand Vulkan knowledge, create a powerful tool and have fun and tackle challenges along the way. 

## Progress
Currently at: Basic UI implementation

Finished: Index buffers

Most recent demo:
